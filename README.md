# Web Scraping with Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to scrape data from a URL using Python.  
The notebook walks through the process step by step, including:

- Sending HTTP requests to a web page
- Parsing HTML content
- Extracting relevant data
- Presenting results in a structured format (e.g., DataFrame)

The project is intended for educational purposes, to show how Python libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` (or similar) can be used for web scraping.
